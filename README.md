# About

A NextJs boilerplate including Redux, Redux-Observable and Styled Components written in Typescript

## Features

This boilerplate is completely typesafe with the help of typesafe-actions.

* **Next.js** - The minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.
* **Typescript** - Superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces.
* **Redux** - A predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
* **Redux-observable** - RxJS-based middleware for Redux.
* **typesafe-actions** - Typesafe utilities designed to reduce types verbosity and complexity in Redux Architecture.
* **Babel** - The compiler for next generation JavaScript.
* **Styled Components** - Style components directly using template literals.
